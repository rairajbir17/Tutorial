<ol>
<li>Wordpress(WooCommerce)</li>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Prestashop</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ol>

But it mostly deals with POS Systems (Point Of Sale systems: Retail POS System, Restaurant POS System etc.). It is a paid one and user have to contract with the company for selling products online.</p>
