As well, users can easily see the products online and can purchase the products. They don\u0026rsquo;t need to visit the store.\nMost of the time, developers go with inbuilt platforms (e.g. E - Commerce platforms) to set up online stores. When it comes to choose E - Commerce for your online store, There are many available platforms.\nSome of the available platforms are:\n Wordpress(WooCommerce) Magento Prestashop Shopify Other  Wordpress Wordpress is emerging website platform these days.

The whole system is constantly wateched by experts (e.g. ethical hackers) searching for defects and eliminating vulnerability by uploading patches.\n  Disadvantages of Magento:\n Technology: Magento is heavily layered and complex coding style makes Magento fairly slow. Therefore, setting up and customizing Magento is more complicated than other platforms. It offers high requirement in server and developers. Magento hosted on dedicated servers or cloud plan to keep store running stably. Developers need to have core technical knowledge and experiences in coding to install and control Magento properly.\n Cost: Users can start with Magento CE with no fee.
